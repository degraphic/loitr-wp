Loitr is based on patent applied technology with significant improvements on the conventional login mechanism.\r\n1. Loitr enables your collaborators(Administrators, Editors, Authors, etc.) to login without requiring them to type their login credentials anywhere. This helps you overcome sniffing, Man-In-The-Middle & key-logging attacks.\r\n1. Loitr also doesn't need to know the usernames or passwords of your collaborators for it to work. Thus Loitr doesn't add to your security risks.\r\n\r\nLoitr is specially great for collaborators working from various off-site locations with questionable online security measures in place. All communication between the Loitr smartphone apps and Loitr is over HTTPS.\r\n\r\nAll your collaborators have to do is download the Loitr app on their phones(Android & iPhones) and scan the activation QR once(available in their Dashboard once the plugin is activated). They can login the next time just by scanning the login QR visible on the login page of your blog.\r\n\r\nFind out about the installation process in <a target='_blank' href='http://youtu.be/0_1sa6soy5U'>this demo video</a>.\r\nThe activation & login process for collaborators is <a target='_blank' href='http://youtu.be/EYwhc8mKr1o'>shown here</a>.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

Loitr enables your users to login without typing their login information. More securely & easily.

== Description ==

Secure your Wordpress logins and make it <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication'>2-Factor</a>.

Loitr is based on patent applied technology with significant improvements on the conventional login mechanism.

Loitr enables your collaborators(Administrators, Editors, Authors, etc.) to login without requiring them to type their login credentials anywhere. This helps you overcome sniffing, Man-In-The-Middle & key-logging attacks.

Loitr also doesn't need to know the usernames or passwords of your collaborators for it to work. Thus Loitr doesn't add to your security risks.

Loitr is specially great for collaborators working from various off-site locations with questionable online security measures in place. All communication between the Loitr smartphone apps and Loitr is over HTTPS.

All your collaborators have to do is download the Loitr app on their phones(Android & iPhones) and scan the activation QR once(available in their Dashboard once the plugin is activated). They can login the next time just by scanning the login QR visible on the login page of your blog.

The activation & login process for collaborators is <a target='_blank' href='http://youtu.be/EYwhc8mKr1o'>shown here</a>.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. At this step the plugin needs write permissions in its own folder, database table creation rights & connectivity to the Internet.
2. When the plugin gets activated properly, visit the Loitr Settings section in the Settings menu. It should display the Loitr configuration for your blog. You need to mail the configuration to contact@loitr.in from the email address that is configured as the admin of your blog. We will verify the ownership of the blog and issue you a service identifier. This step takes no more than one business day.
3. Once you receive your service identifier, key it in the input box in the Loitr Settings section and save it.
4. Your Loitr Login install is ready and you should be able to see the Login with Loitr button & Login QR at the login screen after this.

Admins and authors can use Loitr to login into Wordpress dashboard without typing anything.

== Description ==
The Wordpress Loitr Plugin is an authentication plugin for logging in into Wordpress. Features include:

1. Login into Wordpress dashboard by a scan of a QR code using a smartphone

2. Loitr does not store or ask for your Wordpress login username or password on the phone or anywhere else

3. Block lost phones with a single click

4. Available for iPhones and Android phones

All your collaborators have to do is download the Loitr app on their phones(Android & iPhone) and scan the activation QR once (available in their Dashboard once the plugin is activated). They can login the next time just by scanning the login QR visible on the login page of your blog.

The activation & login process for collaborators is <a target='_blank' href='http://youtu.be/EYwhc8mKr1o'>shown here</a>.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress or upload it to your blog's plugins directory.

2. Important: Check the inbox of the admin's email account. (We will send you your Service identifier to the email address designated as the admin of the Wordpress blog)
3. Type in the service identifier in the input provided inside Loitr Settings and Save

Your Loitr Login install is ready and you should be able to see the Login with Loitr button & Login QR at the login screen as well as the Activate QRs in the Dashboard.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have installed Loitr, now how will my collaborators login? =

Your collaborators can activate Loitr login on their phone by downloading the Loitr app on their phones(Android & iPhones). Then they have to login to your blog once to find their Activate QR in their Wordpress Dashboard. Once the Activate QR is scanned with Loitr, your collaborators can simply login using scanning the Loitr Login QR visible on the login page of your blog.

= How secure is this? =

Loitr uses some industry trusted practices & concepts, which include:
1. Simple Public Key Infrastructure
2. Secret Sharing
3. Non-repudiation
4. SSL connections

Also, Loitr never gets to know your Wordpress loginid or password, so we don't add to the security risk of your blog or your collaborators.
In case you would have more questions about security, feel free to write to us at contact@loitr.in

= Is this service free? =

Yes, this service is free uptil 1000 collaborators per installation. So unless you have a thousand people using Loitr on your blog, you don't have to worry. In case there will be more, you can write to us at contact@loitr.in
